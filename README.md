# The Ephemeral Projector: A Comparative Analysis of Quantum Mechanics and Abhidhamma

## Re-evaluating Observer, Reality, Causality, and Consciousness

---

## 📜 Abstract

Previous "Abhidhamma and Quantum Science" comparisons do not converge because they treat quantum mechanics (QM) as a monolithic entity. This paper argues that a more rigorous analysis requires a one-to-one comparison.

We therefore place the core doctrines of Abhidhamma—such as **momentariness** (*khanika-vada*), **dependent origination** (*paṭiccasamuppāda*), and **not-self** (*anattā*)—in direct dialogue with the five leading interpretations of QM.

## 🔬 Methodology: A One-to-One Dialogue

This systematic analysis places Abhidhamma's core doctrines in dialogue with the five leading interpretations of quantum mechanics:

1.  The Copenhagen Interpretation
2.  De Broglie-Bohm Theory
3.  The Many-Worlds Interpretation
4.  Spontaneous Collapse Theories
5.  The Decoherent Histories Formulation

## 📊 Shifting Points of Comparison

This analysis reveals that specific conceptual resonances are **highly contingent on the chosen interpretation**. The points of comparison shift from:

* **The Copenhagen Interpretation:** The pivotal role of the observer and measurement.
* **De Broglie-Bohm Theory:** The tension between deterministic realism and non-local guidance.
* **The Many-Worlds Interpretation:** The integration of the observer into a branching, process-based multiverse.
* **Spontaneous Collapse Theories:** A direct parallel between momentary events and an objective "flash" ontology.
* **Decoherent Histories:** The emergence of classicality through consistent, non-interfering frameworks.

## 🏁 Conclusion

While no single interpretation maps perfectly, the complete survey provides a richer understanding of both Abhidhamma's insights and the deep, unresolved questions in quantum foundations.

> Ultimately, this analysis demonstrates that both traditions were forced, through their own rigorous methods, to deconstruct classical notions of substance, inherent identity, and linear causality. Both converge on a profoundly counter-intuitive, process-based, and relational view of existence.
