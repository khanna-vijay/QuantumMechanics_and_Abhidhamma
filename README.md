# The Ephemeral Projector: A Comparative Analysis of Quantum Mechanics and Abhidhamma

## Re-evaluating Observer, Reality, Causality, and Consciousness

---

## 📜 Abstract

Previous "Abhidhamma and Quantum Science" comparisons do not converge because they treat quantum mechanics (QM) as a monolithic entity. This paper argues that a more rigorous analysis requires a one-to-one comparison.

We therefore place the core doctrines of Abhidhamma—such as **momentariness** (*khanika-vada*), **dependent origination** (*paṭiccasamuppāda*), and **not-self** (*anattā*)—in direct dialogue with the five leading interpretations of QM.

## 🔬 Methodology: A One-to-One Dialogue

This systematic analysis places Abhidhamma's core doctrines in dialogue with the five leading interpretations of quantum mechanics:


* **The Copenhagen Interpretation:** The pivotal role of the observer and measurement.
* **De Broglie-Bohm Theory:** The tension between deterministic realism and non-local guidance.
* **The Many-Worlds Interpretation:** The integration of the observer into a branching, process-based multiverse.
* **Spontaneous Collapse Theories:** A direct parallel between momentary events and an objective "flash" ontology.
* **Decoherent Histories:** The emergence of classicality through consistent, non-interfering frameworks.
  
* **The Copenhagen Interpretation (CI) / Orthodox Position championed primarily by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg.** This view emphasizes the central role of observations and measurements in the very formulation of quantum mechanical laws.
* **The Pilot-Wave Theory / De Broglie-Bohm Theory (DBBT). Suggested by Louis de Broglie and later systematically developed by David Bohm.** DBBT resolves the quantum paradoxes by proposing that a quantum system consists of both a wave and a particle.
* **The Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) / Everett Interpretation. Developed by Hugh Everett III.**  MWI attempts to solve the measurement problem by removing the collapse postulate. MWI maintains that the universal wave function is the only objective reality and that it always evolves exclusively according to the deterministic, unitary Schrödinger equation.
* **Spontaneous Collapse Theories. the Ghirardi, Rimini, and Weber (GRW) model.** Attempt to resolve the measurement problem by unifying the two incompatible dynamical rules (Schrödinger evolution and collapse) into a single, universal process. The Schrödinger equation is modified by introducing intrinsic, stochastic (random) terms that cause the wave function to spontaneously collapse.
* **Consistent Histories (CH) / Decoherent Histories (DH).** This approach, associated with Griffiths, Omnès, Gell-Mann, and Hartle, provides a framework for quantum reasoning.DH aims to assign probabilities to sequences of quantum events (histories) in a way that is mathematically coherent and consistent with the rules of probability, even when those events are not measured.  

The Quantum Mechanics - Choices are then cross referenced onto key Abhidhamma elements

* **The Fundamental Nature of Reality:** The analysis of all existence into its ultimate, momentary phenomena (dhammas) and the smallest material units (kalāpas).
* **Reality as a Dynamic Process:** The doctrine of universal impermanence (Anicca) and its specific analysis as "momentariness" (khanika-vada).
* **The Deconstruction of the Self:** Analyzing the observer via the Five Aggregates (Pañcakkhandhā), consciousness (citta), and the cognitive process (Vīthicitta) to reveal the principle of Not-Self (Anattā).
* **Interconnected Causality:** The framework of Dependent Origination (Paṭiccasamuppāda) as exhaustively detailed in the 24 Conditional Relations (Paṭṭhāna).
* **The Unconditioned State:** The nature of Nibbāna as the goal and the only phenomenon that is not subject to the above principles of conditioning and impermanence.

## 🏁 Conclusion

While no single interpretation maps perfectly, the complete survey provides a richer understanding of both Abhidhamma's insights and the deep, unresolved questions in quantum foundations.

> Ultimately, this analysis demonstrates that both traditions were forced, through their own rigorous methods, to deconstruct classical notions of substance, inherent identity, and linear causality. Both converge on a profoundly counter-intuitive, process-based, and relational view of existence.
